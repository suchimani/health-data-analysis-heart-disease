Heart Disease has some established risk factors such as High Blood Pressure, High Cholesterol and Smoking.  As per the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 47% of all Americans have one of the three risk factors.  Some other factors that we have no control but have an impact on Heart Disease include genetics, environmental factors and aging.  In this dataset I explore two other indicators, Diabetes and higher than normal BMI, and their impact on heart disease. \n","\n","A branch of CDC called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) condcts a telephonic health survey annually that collects state data from U.S. residents regarding their health related risk behaviors and chronic health conditions.  The BRFSS was established in 1984 with surveys conducted in 15 states and since then it has expanded to all 50 states, District of Columbia adn three U.S. territories.  Every year, the BRFSS conducts about 400,000 interviews making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.  \n","\n","The latest survey data conducted was conducted in the year 2020.  The dataset that I have used to do the analysis here, I found on Kaggle and is a subset of the data that comes from this survey.  This dataset has over 300,000 respondents or rows and about 20 variables or columns.  \n","\n","Physicians and health care providers that are directly involved in health of the population are constantly looking for more indicators that may accurately predict heart disease.  Studying a large dataset like this over many years will continue to establish more patterns that can be used to either reduce the incidence of heart disease or tailor medications to prevent heart disease.  \n","\n","Tech companies that are working on wearables that monitor heart rate, step count, sleep and many more in the pipeline are an emerging group that are constantly looking for a large dataset with many key health indicators.  On one hand, tech wearables are getting more advanced and COVID has expanded how much telemedicine can truly accomplish, continuous surveying from the BRFSS program and data like these can help improve lifestyles of individual to reduce risk of heart disease and in turn improve the health of the population.  \n"],"metadata":{"id":"dVc2mYnYCC8i"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Dataset Source and Information:**"],"metadata":{"id":"f1a6lKWyRnuW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The original CDC Data from the latest annual BRFSS survey can be found at the following link.  \n"," [CDC 2020 Annual Health Survey Data](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2020.html)"],"metadata":{"id":"jf3iTEbXWd9k"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Here is the link to the sheet that was created that was used for the data analysis.

The population of United States is 320 million and this dataset has roughly data from 0.1% of the population of United States.  It is a large enough sample to make observations from but not enough to draw inferences or change the standard of care.  This dataset also provides information on physical activity time and asthma that I think might have impact on cardiovascular health as well.  It would be interesting to study BMI and Diabetes among the various races and genders.  This data is being collected across the entire country and therefore an interesting aspect that can be considered is the impact of geographical location and weather on the key indicators of Heart Disease.  \n","\n","Since this is an annual survey, a new dataset is available every year.  It would be interesting to use the annual BRFSS data from one year to the next, across years to see trends.  Physicians and Scientists are constantly studying surveys to improve the health of the population and prevent the progression of heart disease.  They are studying data to identify more predictors of heart disease so they may be able to prevent any adverse event.  On the other hand, advancement in tech wearables are also providing the individual as well as the healthcare providers more information to improve their lifestyle.  Tech companies are constantly innovating along the lines of tech wearables, where today you can track number of steps/ miles walked, cardiovascular output during exercise, resting heart rate, skipped heart beats, sleep, quality of sleep, and many other features such as blood glucose monitoring that are in the pipeline. \n","\n","Post COVID telemedicine in combination with tech advancements with insights from analysis on datasets like these can give more power to indivudual and their healthcare provider to track their health indicators from as early as 30 years of age to prevent heart disease.  With physician oversight and AI advancements that provide tailored care, over time the number of adverse cardiovascular events may hopefully drop and decrease the number of deaths due to heart disease.
